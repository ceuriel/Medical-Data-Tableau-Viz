## Data Preparation & Transformation

As part of the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, the dataset was thoroughly cleaned and refined in tableau to ensure accuracy and reliability. Outliers and inconsistent entries were identified and removed to maintain the integrity of analytical results. Missing or incomplete records were handled appropriately, and the data was standardized for consistent measurement across variables.

To enrich the dataset and add analytical depth, several calculated fields were created in Tableauâ€”such as average heart rate by gender, Gender group to provide additional context and enable meaningful comparisons. Filters were applied to focus on relevant subsets of data, ensuring that visualizations reflect clear, actionable insights.

These transformations not only improved data quality but also enhanced the interpretability of the dashboard, allowing users to explore key health trends with greater clarity and confidence.
